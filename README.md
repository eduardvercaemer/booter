# BIOS interrupts

The BIOS provides basic services via interrupts, the different services
are defined in the `interrupts.inc` file.

The full reference for this interrupts is

## BIOS Services

Different services require arguments in certain registers, the main argument
usually goes in `AH`, the notation for this is `int 0x--,-` where the first
number is the interrupt, and the second is the argument in `AH`.

The video services are provided via `int 0x10`:
- `int 0x10,0` -> set video mode
- `int 0x10,e` -> write text in teletype mode

The keyboard services are provided via `int 0x16`:
- `int 0x16,0` -> wait for a keypress and return character

# Usage

Programs are compiled with `nasm` to binary format, and run in `qemu`.

- `asm.sh` will assemble all sources to binaries
- `run.sh` will run the provided binary in qemu automatically

# Programs

- `hello.asm` is a simple prgram, that will use `int 0x10` to print strings
to the screen.

- `step.asm` is a hello world, but it will print the characters one at a time,
whenever a key is pressed, using `int 0x16,0`

- `echo.asm` will echo keyboard input to screen, until the `return` key is
pressed, using the same `int`'s

- `pixel.asm` will set a VGA graphics mode, and draw a single red pixel using
screen coordinates, utilizing `Ã¬nt 0x10,c`
