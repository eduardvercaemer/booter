# Basic Programs

These are simple programs that introduce the concept
for bootsector programming.

Here I use concepts such as BIOS services for video
output and keyboard input, also I use memory
mapped I/O to output graphics using Video Memory.

# BIOS interrupts

The BIOS provides basic services via interrupts, the different services
are defined in the `interrupts.inc` file.

[For the full bios interrupts reference](https://www.stanislavs.org/helppc/idx_interrupt.html)

## BIOS Services

Different services require arguments in certain registers, the main argument
usually goes in `AH`, the notation for this is `int 0x--,-` where the first
number is the interrupt, and the second is the argument in `AH`.

The video services are provided via `int 0x10`:
- `int 0x10,0` -> set video mode
- `int 0x10,e` -> write text in teletype mode

The keyboard services are provided via `int 0x16`:
- `int 0x16,0` -> wait for a keypress and return character

# Port I/O

We utilize port I/O instructions to read and write to hardware
registers, for this we use the `in` and `out` instructions.

## List of Ports

[VGA Registers](http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/vgareg.htm)
- 0x03c4 -> Sequencer Address Register
- 0x03c5 -> Sequencer Data Register
- 0x03ce -> Graphics Address Register
- 0x03cf -> Graphics Data Register

# Programs

- `hello.asm` is a simple prgram, that will use `int 0x10` to print strings
  to the screen.

- `step.asm` is a hello world, but it will print the characters one at a time,
  whenever a key is pressed, using `int 0x16,0`

- `echo.asm` will echo keyboard input to screen, until the `return` key is
  pressed, using the same `int`'s

- `pixel.asm` will set a VGA graphics mode, and draw a single red pixel using
  screen coordinates, utilizing `Ã¬nt 0x10,c`

- `memmap.asm` will print characters in the screen, by directly writing to
  VGA mapped memory

# Usage

Programs are assembled with `nasm` to binary format, and run in `qemu`.

- `run.sh` will assemble and run the provided program in qemu automatically
- `run.bat` same but for windows (requires nasm and qemu installed)
